# Context-aware-Adaptive-Cross-modal-Inference-Network-for-Few-shot-Visual-Question-Answering
This is a formal implementation of our paper Background driven Proto-Adaptive Convolutional Network for Few-Shot Medical Segmentation. Since our paper has not yet been published, we are only providing code for the implementation of the model. All code will be released soon.
